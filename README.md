## Wins
	- Utilizing new technologies such as React, React Router, and Cypress despite learning it in such a short amount of time.

## Challenges

## Improvements

- Adding a button to toggle the view to favorited movies.
- Allowing users to add their rating of a movie.
- Adding a "404 page not found" page.
